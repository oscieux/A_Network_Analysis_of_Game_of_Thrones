# A_Network_Analysis_of_Game_of_Thrones
 
<p>If you haven't heard of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, then you must be really good at hiding. Game of Thrones is the hugely popular television series by HBO based on the (also) hugely popular book series <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> by George R.R. Martin. In this notebook, we will analyze the co-occurrence network of the characters in the  Game of Thrones books. Here, two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books. </p>

<p>This dataset constitutes a network and is given as a text file describing the <em>edges</em> between characters, with some attributes attached to each edge. Let's start by loading in the data for the first book <em>A Game of Thrones</em> and inspect it.</p>
